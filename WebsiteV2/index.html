            <h2>A Little Information</h2>
            <p>
              I've had an interest in the IT industry specifically development from a young age. I'm looking to persue a career in development now that i have graduated from university with a BSc in computer game design.
              Most of my work throughout university was based on solo projects. This had a great range from modelling to programming.
              This is when my passion grew. I enjoyed creating something from nothing & my goal is to find a junior role that will allow me to continously develop my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you check out my Projects section you can see some of my latest work that i have developed in my spare time.
              My projects are something i found interesting and wanted to have fun trying to make. Some are very basic whilst others took a bit more time. Feel free to follow my github link to view all of projects in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my work life i have plenty of interests and hobbies. I enjoy reading and studying random interests, some of my previous interests have been 3D modelling, web design, software testing & currently i have been reading a lot into marine biology & tend to switch subjects every couple of months. Aside from this i enjoy long walks with my labrador Marley, swimming, basketball, video games & most of all binge watching Netflix series.
            </p>

            <h3>Network Communication System LTD (June 2021&#8594;Current)</h3>
            <p>
              My time with NCS i have worked with software. More specifially software testing. Currently i am working on a new door entry & warden call system.
              Some features of the software are SIP calling, RTSP camera streaming, Tablet to tablet video streaming, MQTT server based on a raspberry pi & privacy options.
              When APKS are sent on a daily basis I fully test the software to find any new bugs that have occured. I am then tasked with creating detailed bug reports to send to developers to meet customer requirements.
              During this time i have also had exposure to Linux and MQTT servers via a raspberry pi. This allows users to send pre-defined messages via local network to all tenants in case of emergency.

            <h3>QA Consulting (July 2019&#8594;March 2020)</h3>
            <p>
              During my time at QA Consulting i worked as both a Data Scientist & a Devops Engineer.
              My first project was to create an application that would take in user input.
              With the knowledge i gained throughout my training with QA I created a UI that would take specific data about a house. The data would go through a linear model which would create a predicted price for that house.
              The project used SQL as a database. Which has testing data saved to it. This was then linked and sourced into R studio where the application models were created. Once the application was complete I deploted it using GCP which would allow me to access from anywhere at any time. All files were then stored on Github for accessability and cloned into the GCP instance. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My second project was to set up a web app using CI integration using Microsoft Azure.
              This involved using Jenkins.
              With the knowledge i gained throughout my time with QA. Once the application was complete all files were stored on Github. I followed this up by setting up an instance in Azure with Jenkins to set up a CI pipeline. When the github files are updated this instantly pulls the new data updating the website.
